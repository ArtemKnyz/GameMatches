# GameMatches
In the game " Matches" you will need to demonstrate your skill calculate moves ahead. 
On the playing field in front of you are twenty wooden sticks. You and the Master of 
Shadows will take turns take one, two or three sticks (how much to take is up to the
player to decide). He who takes the last stick loses, so the goal of the game is to 
leave this stick to the opponent. The right of the first move traditionally  belongs
to you.
